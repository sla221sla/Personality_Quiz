INTP: The Logician

Actually, I have a question. How often do you step out of your house 
willingly, INTP?
INTPs are considered the most logically precise of all the 16 types.
They question everything around them and have been responsible 
for many scientific discoveries throughout history.
Their minds are abuzz with ideas, and they hate being wrong.

Strengths:
1.Great analysts and abstract thinkers.
2.Objective in their behaviour.
3.Imaginative and original: Their ideas may never see the light of day, 
but still prove to be remarkable innovations.$

Weaknesses:
1.They can be very private and withdrawn, even with close friends.
2.Insensitive. Emotional situations are utterly puzzling to these types.
3.Absent minded: When their interest is captured, they can even forget
 about their own health and eating their meals.$
