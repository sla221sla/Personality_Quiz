ISTJ: "The Logistician" 

They are practical and fact minded individuals whose reliability cannot 
be doubted.
They are defined by their integrity, practical logic and dedication.
Laziness+Dishonesty is the quickest way to get on an ISTJ's bad side.
Dependency on others is often seen as a weakness to them.
Sentence:"Honesty is the best policy."$

Strengths:
1.Honest and direct. Integrity is the heart of this type.
2.Excellent at creating and enforcing order.(This means no
polititian is an ISTJ.)
3.Very responsible. A promise means everything to them, and they
will never break a promise.$

Weaknesses:
1.ISTJs can become noticeably angry as deadlines tick nearer.
2.They often unreasonably blame themselves. They load themselves
with work and sooner or later reach a tipping point which they 
simple cannot deliver. Then they blieve that the responsibility
for failure is theirs alone to bear. #sadlife
3.They believe things work best with clearly defined rules.
Unstructured environments may leave them all but paralysed.$
