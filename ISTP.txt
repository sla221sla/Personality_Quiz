ISTP: "Uniqueness Personified"

ISTPs are those who'd probably find it joyful to pull things apart 
and put them back together, a little bit better than before.
 Friendly but very private, calm but suddenly spontaneous, extremely 
curious but unable to stay focused on formal studies, ISTPs can be a
 challenge to predict, even by their friends and loved ones.$
 "I didn't want to go to the same place every day and see the same people 
and do the same job. I wanted interesting challenges," said Harrison 
Ford, an ISTP. Relate with it?
They explore ideas through creating, troubleshooting, trial and
error and first hand experience.
