ENTP: The Master Trollers

You can never truly predict what's going on with ENTPs. 
They'll always have some harebrained scheme racing up their mind.
They are the ultimate Devil's Advocate, thriving on the process of 
shredding arguments of other people. 
They love mental sparring for the simple reason that it's fun, unlike 
their ENTJ counterparts who are trying to achieve some deeper goal.
It is near impossible to make them emotional.
